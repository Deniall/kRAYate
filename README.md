# kRAYate

### kRAYate is a game-making tool. It incorporates the technique of raycasting, a popular form of '2.5D' rendering used in very old (timeless) famous video games such as Doom and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. With our tool, you too can create games like these, using a simple, easy-to-master UI, pre-built functions such as triggers, enemies and texture editing, and then package it all up and send it to your friends.
 
 
 Instructions on how to use the Player in it's current release (v2.0) can be found in the Player folder.

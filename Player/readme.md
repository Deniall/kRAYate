This is going to be the folder where all the code for the new, from-scratch Player application is going to be. 

I (Niall) will be committing here quite regularly, and at the end of every day I will take all the working code from here and commit it to the final repo.


IDE used: Code::Blocks

Libraries and dependancies: SDL.dll and quickcg.cpp/quickcg.h

SDL.dll, quickcg.cpp and quickcg.h must be placed in the directory with the main code. SDL also must be installed on the system being developed on for it to compile properly. Look up tutorials to do this.
